        <h2>When to use macros, add-ins and packages?</h2>
        <p>
          After reading a short overview of the extensibility
          artifacts, a natural question arises: which one should
          I use for a certain extension task?
        </p>
        <aside class="rightBar">
          &quot;...macros are your best friends.&quot;
        </aside>
        <p>
          Macros are quite limited from a functionality point of
          view, because just a small part of the Visual Studio
          features can be accessed by using them and you cannot
          hide the macro source code. However, when this is not an
          issue and you want to provide an extension just to
          automate simple repetitive tasks, macros are your best
          friends. If macros constrain you because you want to
          add more than they offer you, add-ins and packages will
          be your saviors.
        </p>
        <aside class="leftBar">
          Few extensibility options are not available
          through automation model
        </aside>
        <p>
          Add-in development offers a richer set of tools than 
          macros. Besides using the Visual Studio automation 
          model you can extend the user interface easily and 
          consume services provided by other add-ins and packages. 
          Because your code is compiled into a .NET assembly 
          you can use the same deployment and intellectual
          property-defending methods as for any .NET binary. 
          However there are a few extensibility options that 
          are not available through the automation object model 
          or through standard Visual Studio IDE services. 
          In this case you cannot use an add-in, you must 
          create a VSPackage.
