        Now there is a rapidly growing community, 
        the Visual Studio Ecosystem behind Visual Studio. 
        With any idea, imaginings, issues, or questions, 
        you can turn to other community members and 
        leverage the knowledge they have. Welcome to 
        the world of VSX!

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      As a .NET architect and developer I cannot imagine
      my everyday work without Visual Studio. I was 
      always in a strange excitement when waiting for 
      a new CTP, Beta or RTM of Visual Studio because 
      I always expected some great new features with 
      every release. During the years I have bought a 
      few third-party add-ins and utilities for Visual 
      Studio to make my development tasks easier and 
      even created small add-ins to produce some useful 
      piece of code. I knew that Visual Studio was 
      extensible; I downloaded the SDKs and tried to 
      get familiar with those hundreds of extensibility 
      interfaces. However, due to lack of good 
      documentation I often got frustrated.
    </p>
    <h2>Visual Studio: Extensible Platform</h2>
    <p>
      Hearing the word &quot;extensibility&quot; 
      a developer always starts to think &quot;
      some API allowing extra functionality to be 
      added to a product&quot;. More or less, 
      I can agree with this definition in the case 
      of Visual Studio. In this part I tell you how 
      I understand Visual Studio extensibility, and
      what are the ways we can add functionality. Because 
      I started learning this story with the release of 
      Visual Studio 2008, I put the focus on that version.
